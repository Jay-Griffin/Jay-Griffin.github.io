            A quick note on my work
        </h1>
        <p>
            So far most of my work has been as a hobby. While I've always had a passion for games, and I've been coding for about 6 years I had never thought to combine the two unless it was for a rare class assignment. Thats actually what really sparked my intrests in developing games. It was a cs 100 lab where we spent the time learning unity and c#, it immediatly sparked my interest and I started working on games of my own.
            <br>
            Some of my favorite things to work on have been 3d modeling, some shaders, pixel art, drawing (albeit poorly) animations, and clever algorithms. My whole skill set also extends to compute shaders, materials, some level design, and various languages like java, javascript, html, css, and python.

            <p>
                Finding Jemo was the first project I made, right after that cs 100 lab. I worked on it for about 9 months and there's a lot of work in it im proud of. That being said the project is at about 90% completion and I dont really plan on finnishing it. Specifically I really enjoyed the characters and their animations, aswell as the level design.
