                This part is just a brief introduction into who I am. So Hi! My names Jay Griffin I use they/them pronouns I am currently 19 years old and living in Minnesota. Some of my hobbies are video games, movies, drawing, and reading, but really I just like hanging out with my friends (I literally love them so much!) Ive been coding for about 6 years, but I started developing games as a hobby about a year ago and Ive been in love with it ever since. Im currently enrolled at a local community college while I figure out what I want to do for the rest of my college career! I have 2 cats and they are just the CUTEST things in the world I would actually die for them. I currently work as a cashier at ALDI working part time. Its a good job all the people there are friendly and I like working with them. If you need to contact me my email is JayBird5125@gmail.com but I dont check it super frequently (Im working on it ~.~) so it might take a while for me to respond, sorry about that!
